# `MediaWiki Dump Generator`

**MediaWiki Dump Generator can archive wikis from the largest to the tiniest.**

`MediaWiki Dump Generator` is an ongoing project to port the legacy [`wikiteam`](https://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam) toolset to Python 3 and PyPI to make it more accessible for today's archivers.

Most of the focus has been on the core `dumpgenerator` tool. Python 3 versions of the other `wikiteam` tools may be added over time.

## MediaWiki Dump Generator Toolset

MediaWiki Dump Generator is a set of tools for archiving wikis. The main general-purpose module of MediaWiki Dump Generator is dumpgenerator, which can download XML dumps of MediaWiki sites that can then be parsed or redeployed elsewhere.

Wikipedia is far too large to manage the dump easily and [dumps are already freely available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#Where_do_I_get_the_dumps?).

## Installing the tools

For prerequisites and installation see [Installation](./INSTALLATION.md)

## Using the tools

For usage see [Usage](./USAGE.md)

## Publishing the dump

Please consider publishing your wiki dump(s). You can do it yourself as explained in [Publishing](./PUBLISHING.md).
